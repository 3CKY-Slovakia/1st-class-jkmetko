##What's your homework?

##How to work with GitHub version control system?
Whole idea of using VCS is to effectively manage parallel programming and handle sub versions of information system.

## How to use Twitter Bootstrap?
For your 1st lesson, you'll need to import Bootstrap into your project:

1. Download latest stable source version of Twitter Bootstrap (TWBS) from http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/#download
2. Download latest stable jQuery source version from https://jquery.com/download/
3. Copy paste bootstrap files in to your preferable assets folder (eg. assets/vendor/bootstrap/)
4. Link TWBS CSS files in the head of the HTML file:
```
    <!-- Twitter Bootstrap -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/vendor/bootstrap-3.3.5/css/bootstrap.css"/>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/vendor/bootstrap-3.3.5/css/bootstrap-theme.css"/>
```
5. Link jQuery and TWBS JS files just before the end of body tag:
```
    <!-- JS Files -->
    <script src="assets/vendor/jQuery/js/jquery-1.11.3.js"></script>
    <script src="assets/vendor/bootstrap-3.3.5/js/bootstrap.js"></script>
```
